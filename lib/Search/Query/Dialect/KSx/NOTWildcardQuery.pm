=head1 NAME

Search::Query::Dialect::KSx::NOTWildcardQuery - KinoSearch query extension

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 my $query = Search::Query->parser( dialect => 'KSx' )->parse('myfield!:foo*');
 my $ks_query = $query->as_ks_query();
 # $ks_query isa NOTWildcardQuery

=head1 DESCRIPTION

If a WildcardQuery is equivalent to this:

 $term =~ m/$query/

then a NOTWildcardQuery is equivalent to this:

 $term !~ m/$query/

B<Note> that the as_ks_query() method in Dialect::KSx does B<not> use
this class but instead wraps a WildcardQuery in a NOTQuery, which allows
for matching null values as well. So currently this class is not used
by Search::Query::Dialect::KSx but is included here in case someone finds it 
useful.

=head1 METHODS

This class isa Search::Query::Dialect::KSx::WildcardQuery subclass.
Only new or overridden methods are documented.

=head2 make_compiler

Returns a Search::Query::Dialect::KSx::Compiler object.

        include => 0,
    );
